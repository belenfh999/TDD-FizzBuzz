# TDD-FizzBuzz
Implementation of the FizzBuzz Algorithm to learn TDD.
## The FizzBuzz Algorithm
* **Input**
Positive number **N**
* **Output** (condition -> **output)**
  * N is divisible by 3     ->   "Fizz" 
  * N is divisible by 5     ->   "Buzz"
  * N is divisible by 3 & 5 -> "FizzBuzz"
  * Otherwise               ->     N
